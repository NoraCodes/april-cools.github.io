            <p>It started with an idea.</p>

            <p>An idea to make April Fools a day that's more than just a worldwide cringefest. An idea that quickly
                attracted sympathizers. We got started with a small group of people in 2022, but in the following years,
                anyone can participate!</p>

            <p>The idea is pretty simple: on April Fools' Day (also known as “April 1st”), a participant produces
                genuine content that's very different from their normal produced content. It could be a different
                format, a different topic, a different style, anything. The constraints are:</p>

            <ol>
                <li>It is something they normally wouldn't do.</li>
                <li>It is totally genuine: no irony to it.</li>
                <li>It is up to their usual standards of quality.</li>
            </ol>

            <p>For example, some might normally post complex software engineering content to their blog. But this April
                Fools' Day, they are publishing an essay on microscopy, how they got into it, and what it means to them,
                complete with a gallery of their favorite microscopy photos.</p>

            <p>Or, if someone typically writes text, they could make a video instead. Or show off their hobby (like
                juggling, or cooking, or creative writing, …)</p>

            <p>Anything that makes the creator proud, but would be totally unexpected to their audience.</p>

            <p>We figure that this is a great way to be excited about a much broader range of things, things you
                normally don't get a chance to, and it'll be surprising and enriching for readers (or watchers, or
                listeners). The spirit of April Fools' Day without any of the cringe.</p>

                <dt>Is this a joke?</dt>

                <dd>Do you think we registered a novelty domain and had <a
                        href="https://www.instagram.com/wolf.pupy/">an artist</a> draw a logo as a joke?</dd>

                <dt>Who are you?</dt>

                <dd>The initial idea is courtesy of <a href="https://hillelwayne.com/">Hillel Wayne</a>, who recruited a
                    bunch of people to participate early 2022.
